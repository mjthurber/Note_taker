# Description

The Note Taker application is a tool designed for small business owners and individuals to write, save, and organize their notes efficiently. It utilizes an Express.js back end to manage note data storage and retrieval from a JSON file. The application's front end provides an intuitive interface to create, view, and delete notes, offering seamless organization and task management capabilities.

# How to use

Navigate to notes, then write a header for a note you want to save. Then, write the info in the body. After you're satisfied with your note, you can save it. It will appear on the banner in the left.

Once you've completed a note or don't want it any more, simply delete the note by clicking on the trash can.
